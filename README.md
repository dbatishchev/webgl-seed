# WebGL Seed

WebGL starter project boilerplate bundled with Webpack.

## Install
Before you begin, make sure you are comfortable with terminal commands and have [Node and NPM installed](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

### Install with Git
In terminal clone the project into a directory of your choice then delete the git folder to start fresh.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/edwinwebb/three-seed.git my-project
cd my-project
rm -rf .git
npm install
```

## Running the development server
To see the changes you make to the starter project go to the project folder in terminal and type...

```bash
npm start
```

This command will bundle the project code and start a development server at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/). Visit this in your web browser; every time you make changes to the code the page will refresh. Congratulations, you are good to go!
